The directory contains input text files named as follows: in_<N>.dat, where N is a natural number. Each file consists of two lines. 
The first line contains a number indicating the action, and the second line contains floating-point numbers separated by a space.
The actions can be as follows:
1. addition
2. multiplication
3. sum of squares

It is necessary to write a multithreaded application that will perform the required actions on the numbers and write the sum of the results to the out.dat file.
The name of the working directory is passed as an argument of the working line (the number of threads is the same). The use of polymorphism and design patterns is encouraged in the implementation, it is advisable to cover the code with Unit Tests.
